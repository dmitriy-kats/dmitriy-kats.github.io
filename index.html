          <h3>Multi-physics modeling</h3>
          <p>I develop multi-physics computational models for engineering problems primarily dealing with heat transfer and fluid flow. The applications of these models are advanced manufacturing processes, aerospace systems, fluid-structure interaction, and thermal convection flow as shown to the left with the open-source code available on my GitHub.

          <h3>Structual analysis</h3>
          <p>I analyze structures experiencing static, dynamic, and impact loading using hand calculations and finite element analysis. At HDR, I primarily evaluate hydraulic structures and mechanical systems including dams and hydraulic gates. The figure to the left is a representative stress state of a dam experiencing an earthquake.

          <h3>Artificial intelligence</h3>
          <p>I employ artificial intelligence to solve challenging engineering problems by learning hidden governing rules. For metal 3D printing, my collaborators and I created a tool to inform process control in achieving the desired mechanical properties in the 3D printed part. We achieved a 5000X speed up in our prediction speed using an artificial intelligence model trained on computational simulations. I am working on similar approaches for problems in mechanics and asset management.</p>
