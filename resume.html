          <p>
            Dmitriy Kats is a Finite Element Analyst at HDR Engineering. He has five years of experience with finite element analysis of structural and multi-physics problems for government and industry collaborators. At HDR, he is creating finite element structural models of dams and other hydraulic structures for static and dynamics loads. He transforms workflow through automation of data processing which saves time and money. Dmitriy is skilled in addressing engineering needs by implementing engineering tools and algorithms from published papers and workshops in Python. Dmitriy is passionate in developing engineering solutions by employing numerical tools.
